## 🎯 Problem

The Asas Abertas Aeroclub managed students, instructors, and flight scheduling manually — with paper and spreadsheets. Without digital control, scheduling conflicts, lost information, and communication failures arose, compromising operations and flight safety.

Reported issues:
- Two students booking the same instructor or aircraft at the same time ✖️
- Erasures and lost sheets make it impossible to track cancellations and attendance 🗂️
- Duplicate charges and unrecorded payments cause financial losses 💸
- Incorrectly applied discounts create friction with students ⚠️
- Aircraft double-booked for the same time slot, discovered only on the tarmac 🛬
- Instructor shows up with no student due to a communication failure 📣
- Student arrives to find the aircraft under maintenance with no prior notice 🔧

> In aviation, an information failure goes beyond administrative issues — it compromises **safety**.

---

## 📈 Market

**Organization Is a Priority!**

Aeroclubs and civil aviation schools in Brazil face growing demand for civil pilots and an increasing need for operational digitization. ANAC regulations and Air Force requirements create record-keeping obligations that manual systems cannot support safely.

The system was validated with real users from the Coroa do Avião Aeroclub (PE), which operates under the same pain points. Similar systems exist at large aviation schools but are inaccessible or unsuitable for mid-sized aeroclubs.

![Market](https://github.com/thaynabds/AeroclubAsasAbertas/blob/main/Mercado.png)

## 📋 Technical Documentation

### 1. Problem Definition

The Asas Abertas Aeroclub struggles with manual management of administrative and operational data. As the number of students and members grows, paper- and spreadsheet-based control has become inefficient, generating errors, flight-safety risks, and financial losses.

**Summary:** Manual data management at the aeroclub causes errors, risks, and losses. As members and students increase, spreadsheets and paper cause disorganization, making real-time control difficult.

#### Critical Points Addressed by the System

- **No digital class records:** solved with the Instructor Logbook (full record) and the Student Logbook (read-only, filtered by service type).
- **No role-based access control:** email/password login with distinct profiles — student, instructor, and administrator.
- **Scheduling difficulty:** a schedule with time-slot visualization, service-type selection (Theory Class, Practical/Flight Class, Simulator, or Aircraft Rental), and cancellations up to 3 days in advance.
- **No centralized registration:** a Registration screen unifying personal data, aeronautical documentation, medical certificate (CMA), licenses, and specializations.
- **No overview:** a Home dashboard with metrics on monthly flights, flight hours, active students, and upcoming bookings.

#### 1.2 Proposed Solution

A front-end web platform built with HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript, focused on the functionalities requested by NTTData for the Asas Abertas Aeroclub in Pernambuco. The system centralizes registrations, bookings, and class history by user profile.

**Delivered functional screens:**

| Screen | Description |
|------|-----------|
| Login | Email, password, "Remember me," and a link to registration |
| Home | Metric cards, navigation, and upcoming bookings |
| Schedule | Search by date/service type, color legend, and booking |
| Instructor Logbook | Full class records, grades, performance coefficient, and notes |
| Student Logbook | Read-only view, filtered by service type |
| Registration | Separate tabs for students and instructors, admin-only access |

**Screens under construction:** Theory Class Schedule, Flight History, Maintenance, Documents, Finance, Statement, and Training.

#### 1.3 Where AI Adds Value

| Dimension | Application |
|----------|-----------|
| Automation | Automatic registration, data organization, and status updates |
| Prediction | Class demand forecasting, preventive maintenance, and default risk |
| Content Generation | Automatic reports, document expiration alerts, and performance analysis |

**AI in project development:**
- Defining registration form fields based on real practices from aviation schools
- Gathering the data needed for the booking schedule
- Generating themed images via Gemini (Nano Banana) for screens under construction
- Assisting with documentation production and backlog structuring

#### 1.4 Personas

**Persona 1 — Lucas, 22 | Aspiring Private Pilot Student (PP – Airplane)**

| | |
|-|-|
| **Profile** | Young person pursuing his first Private Pilot license. No prior formal aviation experience. |
| **Goal** | Complete the PP-Airplane course, accumulate flight hours, and earn his license. |
| **Needs** | Book practical classes, check schedules, check evaluation approval and taught content. |
| **Watch-out** | Must keep payments current and submit required documents to avoid being blocked from classes. |

**Persona 2 — Juliana, 34 | Certified Flight Instructor**

| | |
|-|-|
| **Profile** | Licensed pilot who teaches theory and practical classes, tracks student progress, and manages mission records. |
| **Goal** | Log classes efficiently, track student progress, and manage her monthly schedule. |
| **Needs** | Report availability, log flight time, occurrences, attendance, grades and content; approve or reject cancellations. |

#### 1.5 AI Edge Cases

| Scenario | Impact |
|---------|---------|
| Data loss | A system failure could cause loss of class and booking records |
| Financial control error | Duplicate charges or an incorrect discount (15% for upfront payment) cause losses |
| Scheduling conflict | Without real-time sync, resources risk being double-booked |
| Student in default | A failure in financial validation could violate business rules |
| Late cancellation | The system blocks it and enforces the 3-day advance-notice rule |
| Low-accuracy AI | Predictions below 70% accuracy must trigger human review |
| Expired / missing document | A student without a valid CMA is automatically blocked |

#### 1.6 Interviews and Hypothesis Validation

Interviews were conducted with real users of the Coroa do Avião Aeroclub (PE) to validate the identified needs. Feedback was organized by access profile: student/member, instructor, Maintenance & Inventory admin, and Operations admin. AI (Gemini and ChatGPT) was used as a complementary intelligent agent for hypothesis validation and requirements gathering.

### 5. Process Report and Prompt Engineering

#### 5.1 Prompt Repository

**Prompt 1 — Student Registration Form Fields**
> _"What information is needed to register a student at a civil pilot school in Brazil? Consider personal data, aeronautical documentation, and emergency contact information."_

✅ **Result:** Full Name, National ID (CPF), ID card (RG), Date of Birth, Email, Phone, Address, Medical Certificate (CMA), Prior Experience.
⚠️ **Adjustment:** The AI suggested a "passport number" field, not applicable in the national context — removed manually.

---

**Prompt 2 — Instructor Registration Form Fields**
> _"What information is needed to register a flight instructor at an aeroclub in Brazil? Consider licenses, flight hours, and specializations."_

✅ **Result:** Name, National ID (CPF), ID card (RG), License Number, License Category, Total Flight Hours, Years of Experience, Specializations.
✅ **Adjustment:** None — the output was directly applicable to the screen design.

---

**Prompt 3 — Booking Schedule Structure**
> _"For a scheduling calendar for a flight school and aircraft rental, what service types and additional fields should be available to ensure complete, conflict-free bookings?"_

✅ **Result:** Service types (Theory Class, Practical/Flight Class, Simulator, Aircraft Rental) and a time-slot status legend.
⚠️ **Adjustment:** A class-duration field suggested by the AI was omitted to keep the form simpler.

---

**Prompt 4 — Image Generation for Under-Construction Screens**
> _"Generate an under-construction page image with an airplane-piloting theme, vector illustration style, blue and white colors, showing mechanics working on an aircraft."_

✅ **Result:** Image used on all screens marked "Under construction."
⚠️ **Adjustment:** 3 iterations were needed to get an adequate visual result.

#### 5.2 AI Report · Use of AI in the Site's Code

> No artificial intelligence was used to produce the site's code. All front-end code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) was developed manually by the Squad 43 team. AI tools were used only to support requirements validation, form-field definition, and generating themed images for screens under construction.
